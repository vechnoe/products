The phone is durable, but I still recommend getting a protective covering for a modest sum of money to protect your investment. This iPhone has everything one needs to navigate through their daily lives at a time of fast-paced living. It's surreal that something so small can do so much. The best part is the extremely user-friendly interface that makes owning one of these phones a very attractive endeavor instead of a nightmare. The jury is still out as to whether 8 gb is enough for me, but it seems to be as of the moment. I recommend the iPhone 4 for all of your daily activities all in the palm of your hand.",
